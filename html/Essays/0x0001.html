    <h2>Neo-Luddism in the era of AI</h2>
    <p>
    I would like to open this essay by saying that I am very strongly against
    Neo-Luddism. I find it to be mostly an exercise in futility - can you
    really halt a movement that takes a life of its own once it really gets
    going? Betteridge's law of headlines holds true here as well, of course.
    And so we find ourselves in a time of truly neck-breaking technological
    changes, for which the current systems of power (Adam Curtis would be
    proud) are usually too slow to react to. 
    </p>
    <p>
    In most arguments, I tend to attempt and view both sides as best I can, to
    varying effect - on subjects pertaining to technology the effect is really
    diminished. I grew up with a very specific ideal of what technology should 
    be, so I find it difficult to reconcile when technological progress races 
    off to the near-opposite direction. Regardless.
    </p>
    <p>
    On the positives, there's of course the billions of hours of soul-crushing
    work that are performed on a yearly basis that AI could really streamline.
    Entire lives spent in front of excel spreadsheets, tax documents, you name
    it. I personally believe strongly that every person has a calling to them,
    and I have a suspicion that sitting in front of a computer placing numbers in
    different cells is not it, for most.
    </p>
    <p>
    Then you have self-driving cars. A true technological feat, the
    door is now open for people to get blackout drunk and still get home safe.
    Considering automobile accidents are one of the leading causes of premature 
    death worldwide, this is a cause for celebration. At this point - and
    potentially sooner for some - a voice in the back of your head is probably
    telling you "yes, sure Chris, however".
    </p>
    <p>
    However, what about the fact that cars are now software-controlled? What
    about the fact that they can be hacked? What about the fact that this is a
    technology that belongs almost solely to Tesla? What about all the people
    that AI will put out of a job when there's no more numbers to put in cells?
    I don't consider these to be the <strong>true</strong> problems of AI. I
    find them to be immediate problems needing solutions, of course, but they
    are reactionary more than anything else. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I would like to interject in my own thought process here for a second and
    state the obvious - AI has been around for decades, and what is now being
    popularized are advances in specific subfields (mostly generative AI, in
    the case of chatGPT, the main method of interacting with the AI overlords by
    everyday people). For sensationalist as well as purely aesthetic reasons, I
    talk about "AI" here focusing on the subject as one would view it from a
    philosophical perspective. A black box that takes in input and produces
    output akin to that of an intelligent being.
    </p>
    <p>
    With that out of the way, let us return our focus to problems AI creates in
    the <i>now</i>. I find them to be no different than the "problems" created
    by the automobile industry, or fridges, or the industrial revolution. And
    again, you will say;  but Chris, the industrial revolution and its
    consequences- and I will agree, partly. It has not all been a simple, 
    temporal, reactionary problem that can simply be solved with the creation of new
    jobs as humanity evolves. And this takes me to my next point.
    </p>
    <p>
    The <strong>real</strong> problems of AI, are philosophical in nature, in
    my view. AI is created in the image of its creators, and this primordial
    pool is not a fun one to look at, from the get-go. This has to do with how
    AI operates - there is an input, as mentioned, which is then moved to a
    black box, and then there is an output. And humans don't understand
    the black box part now, and it is likely that as AI gets more and more
    complex that humans will <strong>never</strong> understand the black box
    part. So really, you have an input and an output, take it or leave it.
    </p>
    <p>
    But let us assume that for better or for worse the mathematics behind the
    black box part is sound (this is not an easy assumption to make, and
    thousands of statisticians spun in their graves as you read that sentence).
    Surely one can make the argument now that the output is good - in a perfect
    world perhaps. But we live in a deeply imperfect world, with millenia of
    deep-seated hatreds, injustices and atrocities. There is not enough trolley
    problem images in the world to even begin to describe how difficult it
    would be to "level the playing field" for an AI, when we cannot even do the
    same as humans. 
    </p>
    <p>
    To visualize this problem for someone less tech-savvy, consider this very
    rough sketch of an example, meant simply to outline the problem. Let's
    assume you come from a poor family, and are seeking a loan from your local 
    community bank. Your ancestors haven't had the opportunity to perform money
    management before, as in prior states of government it was a privilege
    reserved for the already wealthy. The times have changed however, and 
    you, vowed to make the most of your newfound freedom of choice. You now go to the
    bank, and their Frankenstein's version of Clippy takes in your details and
    will then tell you if you are eligible for a loan (let's assume for the
    sake of brevity that there is no risk calculations at play). The AI now
    sees that no one you are related to has ever taken out a loan before.
    Immediately, you would start off with a disadvantage. 
    </p>
    <p>
    One does not need much imagination to see the above play out, as it
    effectively already is the way the system works. The only difference is
    there are humans that are more-or-less able to understand the system and
    can slightly lean on the scales a bit to make it fairer. However, as AI
    progresses and is able to take more and more of this workload, the problems
    will no doubt start to accumulate and create massive societal rifts. This
    is mostly fact, as far as I am concerned.
    </p> 
    <p>
    The "solution" to the above, however, is also very problematic. Governments
    all around the world will attempt to put their finger on the scale not as
    outside observers, as your random bank clerk might, but as part of the
    system, effectively building it in. Even assuming no corruption as is
    usually encountered during any bureaucratic process and system of power, it
    would be impossible to predict what the outcome of such a built-in
    counterweight would be, when one does not understand the black box to begin
    with, and what alteration of the input leads to a "better" output. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Which kind of hints to my main struggle with AI, which I saved for last. I
    could go on forever, of course, but I will no doubt return to this topic
    someday, and I do not really like to theorize ad nauseum. So far, humans
    have progressed technologically at a given pace, but now they are putting
    more and more faith in a system which they do not (for the most part)
    understand, that is very much beholden to a board of directors and has to
    turn a profit. No doubt, people are already putting more blind faith into 
    it than they should. It can summarize a page for you, it can translate 
    words for you, it can book "the cheapest" plane tickets for you, once 
    given your financial information. 
    </p>
    <p>
    It is very difficult for me to come to a conclusion here, both on the
    question of AI as well as thematically on this essay, but I keep returning to a
    quote from the film Pulse by Kiyoshi Kurosawa; <q>No matter how simple the 
    device, once the system's complete, it'll function all on its own and become 
    permanent</q>. This system has become permanent, and we need to learn to
    live with it, to understand its shortcomings and how our own human nature
    can work against us. It is going to be a difficult road ahead.
