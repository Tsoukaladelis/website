            <h2>The writing system, all three of it</h2>
            <p>
            As hopefully evident, you and me both will have to go through
            learning three different writing systems. Let's go through them:
            </p>
            <h3>Hiragana</h3>
            <p>
            This is the official Japanese phonetic alphabet, consisting 
            of 48 characters (including 2 that are no longer used). Each
            character represents a different syllable, and obviously not
            all sounds are covered
            </p>
            <h3>Katakana</h3>
            <p>
            The phonetic alphabet used for words derived from other languages,
            such as 'hamburger'. Also consists of a total of 48 characters 
            (including 3 that are no longer used). It looks and feels 
            simpler than hiragana, and also serves a purpose of modernizing
            specific aspects of Japanese (mostly sounds not included in the 
            original alphabet).
            </p>
            <h3>Kanji</h3>
            <p>
            The pictographic alphabet, and effectively what keeps Japanese
            from being a relatively easy-to-learn language such as English.
            Many of the characters here represent either a word, or part of
            a word. They have usually at least two different readings each (which
            situationally change). On the average everyday situation, you would
            expect to run into ~3,000 of them, a fraction of a total 50,000+ characters.
            </p>
