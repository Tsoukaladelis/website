        <h2>Starting Out</h2>
        <h3>The Very Basics</h3>
        <p>
        Even starting will be impossible for anyone, if they do not have a
        mastery of Hiragana. This is partly because Japanese grammar in itself
        relies heavily on Hiragana for near-everything. Many times, books and
        other media will explain how a Kanji is meant to be read by annotating
        it with Hiragana (this specific version is called "Furigana" but it is
        functionally equivalent, as in they are still Hiragana characters). And
        of course, the entire phonetic basis of the language is viewed through
        the lens of Hiragana. It is of vital importance therefore that one
        learns them sooner rather than later. 
        </p>
        <h3>Learning Hiragana</h3>
        <p>
        There are a lot of opinions about how one should learn Hiragana. There
        are even books<a href="#heisig-footnote">[1]</a> on the subject. In my
        opinion, it won't take one that long to learn them well enough even
        though some look very similar to warrant thinking too much about this.
        Simply reviewing them daily for a few weeks, writing them down and
        focusing on the ones that look very similar (i.e. ね and れ) will get
        you through it. You will come across them so often that it will be
        near-impossible to forget any, much like you can recognize all the
        individual letters in this text. The following table (read top to 
        bottom, right to left, which is the Japanese way of doing things) 
        lists all of them and their respective "stroke order", more simply the
        order in which you are to draw the lines to write each one down. Feel 
        free to ignore "wi" and "we", as they are now obsolete.

        <h3>Learning Katakana</h3>
        <p>
        While you're at it, you might as well learn the Katakana. In modern
        Japanese, Katakana get a lot of usage, and therefore you will run into
        them very often as well. What worked for me was writing the Hiragana
        and Katakana for each phonetic unit back to back so that the
        association would stick (i.e. writing あ and then ア). Yes the Hiragana
        and its respective Katakana generally look very dissimilar. Yes, most
        Katakana look very similar to each other. It is what it is. Much like
        Hiragana, you can safely ignore "wi" and "we". "wo" will ever
        only be used as a particle, and even then very rarely (its Hiragana 
        version is what is used in 99.99% of cases), so you can safely ignore 
        that as well.
