        <h2>Kanji vs. Grammar vs. Vocabulary</h2>
        A subject of much, much debate. Grammar and Vocabulary both heavily
        rely on Kanji, so you will need to learn at least <strong>some</strong>
        Kanji at first. Personally, I went through Heisig's "Remembering the
        Kanji" book to learn the "basic" list of 2,200 Kanji. In retrospect,
        this was a massive waste of time. My goal was 20 new Kanji a day (which
        was optimistic at best, as I had very limited free time overall), and
        in general it took me something like 9 months to go through all of
        them. I believe it would be much better for someone to learn a subset
        of those (more specifics on this in a bit) and then move on to Grammar
        and Vocabulary as one is slowly picking up more and more Kanji. 
        <h3>A sidenote on fonts</h3>
        Kanji are characters the Japanese borrowed from Chinese. Many times,
        they look identical to their Chinese version, but oftentimes there are
        minute differences, like an extra line here, a gap there and so on. It
        is ideal to make sure one uses a font that makes sure to use the
        correct Japanese version. By default, your phone or computer will most
        likely use a Chinese font. You should make sure that you are using a
        Japanese font. I personally use the IPA font, but you're free to use
        any you feel look best. If the following characters look like the
        image on the left rather than the one on the right, you're set.

        <h3>Radicals</h3>
        Radicals are a subset of Kanji, that are used as "building blocks" in
        creating other Kanji. For instance, 木 is used to make 森, and so on. 
        There are about 200 of them in all, and because 
        by their nature they are the base building blocks, they are much easier 
        to learn. I mean what looks easier to you to remember, 人 or 鬱? You 
        probably can't even tell what the one on the right actually looks like 
        in your browser without zooming in to like 400% (it is, however, one of 
        the 2,200 "basic" kanji). A way of thinking about non-radical kanji is
        that they are "mental results" of what happens when you combine
        radicals. The prior example is a perfect encapsulation. 木 is the Kanji
        for "Tree". Many 木 together make 森, which is the Kanji for "Forest".
        This is how these Kanji have come about, historically. This historical
        process can be observed in some other more "fun" ways, for instance:
        <br>
        田 (Rice Field) and 力 (Power) give us 男 (Man), whereas 少 (Few) and 力
        (Power) give us 劣 (Inferior). You can probably see the historical
        reasoning.
        <h3>Readings</h3>
        The bane of your existence. Kanji can have multiple readings (i.e. it
        can be read in multiple different ways). The readings change depending 
        on if they're by themselves (generally called "kun'yomi"), if they're 
        part of a compound word (on'yomi), if they're on the left of a compound 
        word, if they're on the right, other contextual clues. It's a nightmare, 
        really. 生 itself has more than ten different readings. Also, it goes
        without saying but if you have 3,000+ "common" Kanji, you run out of
        unique readings pretty fast. Therefore, a lot of Kanji share readings,
        but you won't really have to worry about that for a while. Generally
        speaking, you will learn by repetition and exposure over time when
        reading and listening. 
        <h3>Anki</h3>
        This is the best piece of software with regards to language learning,
        hands down. It is a flashcard program, free to download (and
        open-source) with its own spaced repetition algorithm that calculates
        how often you see new cards. There's multiple guides for using Anki out
        there, so I'll skip that task :)
        <br>
        With regards to a deck for learning radicals, I can recommend <a
        href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1722008986">this deck</a>, but
        you're free to use whichever you wish. 
        <h3>What about Grammar and Vocabulary?</h3>
        Once you have the radicals down (or alternatively at the same time) I 
        recommend you start studying basic Vocabulary.
        I very strongly recommend the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1196762551">
        Kaishi 1.5k deck</a> which contains a curated list of 1,500 words that
        you <strong>will</strong> run into a lot. After you have gone through
        500-1000 of those words, it would be time to start looking into
        Grammar. There are various really strong grammar guides out there, some
        more "traditional" like <a href="https://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar">
        Tae Kim's Guide to Japanese Grammar</a>, or <a href="https://sakubi.neocities.org/">
        Sakubi</a>, as well as a personal favorite in video format, namely
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSvH9vH60Ig&list=PLg9uYxuZf8x_A-vcqqyOFZu06WlhnypWj">Cure
        Dolly's youtube series</a>. You can't really go wrong with any of these.
        After you have your vocabulary, grammar and some kanji down, you can
        start the actual fun part of the journey.
