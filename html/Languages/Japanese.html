            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
            Japan is a very interesting country with a long history, and an
            even longer list of works of art ranging from literature to 
            film. I became interested in learning Japanese when I started
            watching Japanese cinema, and sadly a lot of it remains completely
            untranslated (or even worse, mistranslated) to this day. Thus began
            my journey into a hackish DIY of appreciating films that evolved
            into (so far attempts of) reading literature. Everyone might have
            different goals, of course, but if you find yourself here, then
            I assume some interest in learning the language.

            This is going to be less of an instructional thing, and more of a
            personal collection of experiences - what works for me, what 
            doesn't, and what is vital to learning the language. I am going to
            give as much freely available material as possible here.
            Considering the multitude of online resources when it comes to
            learning Japanese, some would argue you need a guide for picking
            a Japanese learning guide. I'm strictly using my own hacks and 
            workarounds ,but at times I will point to other techniques
            that I ignored, and give reasons for doing so. You might disagree,
            and branch off to different methods. That is for the best, and I
            strongly urge you to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
            What should be stressed most of all, is this is going to be a <b>very</b>
            long process. It will take most people years to acquire a basic
            understanding of the language and its vocabulary, and depending on
            what path you follow, you might be none the wiser of how to speak
            or comprehend even the most basic sentences after months of effort
            - in my opinion, that is the way to go, as it will give you a more
            solid foundation. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I also stress that this is purely a hobby to me, and any of the
            advice shared here taken as anything more than advice, is at your
            own risk of wasted time.

            <h2>The writing system, all three of it</h2>
            <p>
            As hopefully evident, you and me both will have to go through
            learning three different writing systems. Let's go through them:
            </p>
            <h3>Hiragana</h3>
            <p>
            This is the official Japanese phonetic alphabet, consisting 
            of 48 characters (including 2 that are no longer used). Each
            character represents a different syllable, and obviously not
            all sounds are covered
            </p>
            <h3>Katakana</h3>
            <p>
            The phonetic alphabet used for words derived from other languages,
            such as 'hamburger'. Also consists of a total of 48 characters 
            (including 3 that are no longer used). It looks and feels 
            simpler than hiragana, and also serves a purpose of modernizing
            specific aspects of Japanese (mostly sounds not included in the 
            original alphabet).
            </p>
            <h3>Kanji</h3>
            <p>
            The pictographic alphabet, and effectively what keeps Japanese
            from being a relatively easy-to-learn language such as English.
            Many of the characters here represent either a word, or part of
            a word. They have usually at least two different readings each (which
            situationally change). On the average everyday situation, you would
            expect to run into ~3,000 of them, a fraction of a total 50,000+ characters.
